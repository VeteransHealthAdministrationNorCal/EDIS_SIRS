# EDIS_SIRS
The first part of this application tracks the use of the SIRS/Sepsis screening tool developed in the ED. If a patient meets any of the 4 SIRS criteria, an order set is placed and sets a health factor.
The application reports whether a health factor was populated correctly, computes the patient's SIRS score, given most recent labs and vitals on the day of admission.
The second part of the application details the counts over time of sepsis NOT present on admission (i.e. in-house complication) and the sepsis PRESENT on admission. Mortality is color coded in red. 
This visual is for the purpose of surveillance.
